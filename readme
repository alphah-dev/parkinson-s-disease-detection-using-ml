# Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based approach to detect Parkinson's disease using various classification models. The repository contains data preprocessing scripts, model training files, and a graphical user interface for predictions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing for handling input datasets
- Implementation of machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM)
- Pre-trained models stored in `.pkl` format for easy loading
- GUI-based application for user-friendly predictions

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies. You can install them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Run the preprocessing script to prepare the dataset:
   ```bash
   python data_processing.py
   ```
2. Train the model (if needed):
   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```
3. Launch the graphical user interface:
   ```bash
   python graphic_era_app.py
   ```
4. Use `main.py` to execute the detection pipeline:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Files Description
- `data_processing.py` - Handles data preprocessing and feature extraction
- `model.py` - Defines and trains machine learning models
